Higher order component is a component that takes a component, enhances the component and give it back,

Controlled components

- parent controls the component for any changes to the child component.

Lifting the state up in react - react.dev

Props drilling: passing data down to the children

React context - avoids props drilling

Context - central global object - not exactly but can be used all over the components
