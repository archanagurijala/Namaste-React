Single reponsibility principle
Modularity: multiple tasks should be broken down into other components.
Code becomes reusable, testable and maintabnable, readable.
Hooks are like utility functions
Hook and component become modular by using custom hooks.

Code Splitting/Chunking/Lazy Loading /Dynamic Bundling/on demand aLoading/ Dynamic Import

Lazy Loading - when we go to the link the code related to it is loading

Lazy Laoding React - wrap component using suspense and give a placeholder(fallaback) what should React render when the component is still not available.
